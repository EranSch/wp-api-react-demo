# wp-api-react-demo

Hey there! This is a demo repo used for a cursory introduction presentation on React
basics and how a simple app built on react might interface with a WordPress API.

That all said, you may also use this a super-bare React started project. Just be sure
to start with 1f2fa77 if you'd like a bare project. 

## Get Started

1. You'll want to make sure you've got NodeJS installed (I used v5.6.0 but this shouldn't be too specific). Head over to [node's homepage](https://nodejs.org/en/) to get rolling with that stuff.  
2. Make sure you have webpack installed globally: `npm install -g webpack`
3. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
4. Fire up the dev server: `npm start` 
5. Open up [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to view the running site

## Have fun!
